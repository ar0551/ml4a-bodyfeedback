# Body feedback

## Description
The goal is to design and develop a tool for physiotherapeutic treatment, to be used to stimulate motor activity in kids with reduced mobility due to neurological diseases.
The main idea is to stimulate motor activity through sound feedback.
The use of machine learning (neural networks) in necessary to adapt the interaction to the specific and peculiar motor abilities of kids.
The sonic system relies on a three dimensional map where different sounds are localised basing on their correlations (https://github.com/opendot/ml4a-soundcube).
